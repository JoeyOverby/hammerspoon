# hammerspoon
My Hammerspoon Config for use on MacOS

To use this, install [hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) . 
As of 2023-12-11, I used [this release](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/releases/tag/0.9.100).

Then download the `hammerspoon` folder in the repo. Move it to your user dir. `cd ~`. Rename the folder to be `.hammerspoon`. 

# Important Notes
I'm used to Windows and have a Microsoft keyboard (for my Mac). So in my init.lua file this is why you will see the keys named as such. 

```

-- Variables to clarify my keyboard 
winKey = "ctrl" 
ctrlKey = "cmd" 
altKey = "alt" 
shiftKey = "shift"
```

In the Keyboard -> Modifier Keys (System Preferences), have remapped 
Control (^) -> Command
Command Key -> ^ Control
